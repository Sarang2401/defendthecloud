        <h1>Engineering Notes on Cloud, DevOps & Security</h1>

        <p>
          This is a technical blog focused on real-world infrastructure,
          cloud architecture, DevOps workflows, and security engineering.
          The content here is based on hands-on experimentation, system design,
          failures, and lessons learned while working with modern cloud-native systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of tutorials written in isolation, this blog documents
          <strong>how systems behave in practice</strong> — under load,
          under attack, and under operational constraints.
