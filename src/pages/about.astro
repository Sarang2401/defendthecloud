        <p>
          <strong>DefendTheCloud</strong> is a cybersecurity and cloud security
          knowledge platform focused on simplifying complex security concepts
          without losing technical depth.
        </p>

        <p>
          In an increasingly hostile digital landscape, understanding how systems
          fail — and how to defend them — is no longer optional. This site exists
          to bridge the gap between theory and real-world security practices.
